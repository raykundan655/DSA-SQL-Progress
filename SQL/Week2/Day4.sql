-- This table may contain duplicate rows.
-- Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 
-- Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.
-- Return the result table in any order.

-- employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
-- Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
--  Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.
